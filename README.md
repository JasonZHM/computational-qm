# Computational Quantum Mechanics

This repo contains the code for a course I attend on computational quantum mechanics at Tsinghua.

List of the code:

1. `/task1`: Exact Diagonalization of Hubbard Model
2. `/task2`: Dispersion Relation of Transverse-field Ising Model and Time Evolution of Wave Packet
3. `/task3`: Traditional Finite Size DMRG for Transvers-field Ising Model
4. `/task4`: Matrix Product Operator of Square Lattice Compass Model
